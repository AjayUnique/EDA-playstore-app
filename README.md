# PlayStore App Data Review Analysis

## problem Statement
The expansion of smartphones is driving the fast development of mobile app stores. Currently, the two largest global platforms for app distribution are Appleâ€™s App Store (for iOS users) and Google play store (official app store for the Android OS). For our research, we have picked the Google play store and did a thorough analysis of its features that were available to us for predicting the success of a particular app. But the question arises, is it even necessary to do so? Well, the answer is yes, that is because to be precise an average of 3739 mobile apps are released through the Google Play Store every day, according to the statistics shown by Statista in their recent report. And the number of the huge number of apps in the play store and the number of the app released every day make it quite competitive for the app developers, and the companies who are building an app to come up with a unique idea that will be bought by the end-users. Because at the end of the day if the app does not perform well in the android market, then all the hard work behind building the app will go in vain. As the mobile industry is growing rapidly it is increasing the level of competition however, increased competition also leads to increased chances of failure. So, the developers need to do enough research as an enormous amount of time, effort, and money is invested into the process, so businesses cannot afford an app failure. Success is a thing that does not come to one so easily and for that, we analyzed the features of the Google play store and came to a conclusion that will help developers to understand their app success rate using our proposed success parameters.

## Steps involved

## 1. Data Preparation
Data preparation is the process of cleaning and transforming raw data before processing and analysis. It is an important step before processing and often involves reformatting data, making corrections to data, and combining data sets to enrich data.
## 2. Gathering data
This step is about getting to know the data and understanding what has to be done before the data becomes useful in a particular context. This can be done by reading the CSV file and doing an initial statistical analysis. Though the dataset may seem to have the correct data types for each column, we need to check it. Inconsistent data types will create issues while dealing with problems.
## 3. Cleaning and validating data
This step is crucial for removing faulty data and filling in gaps. Important tasks here include:
* Removing extraneous data.
* Filling in missing values.
* Conforming data to a standardized pattern.
* Remove the duplicate values.

## 4. Transform data
Transforming data is the process of updating the format or value entries to reach a well-defined outcome, or to make the data more easily understood by a wider audience. Correcting the data types which variables need to be brought to numeric Rating, Installs, Size Reviews, and Price.
Since the sizes of the applications present in the dataset are MB and KB. Therefore, for ease in data processing, the entire size column is converted to MB.
## 5. Null values Treatment
Our dataset contains a large number of null values which might tend to disturb our accuracy hence we dropped them at the beginning of our project to get a better result.
## 6. Exploratory Data Analysis 
Exploratory data visualizations (EDVs) are the type of visualizations we assemble when we do not have a clue about what information lies within our dataset.

## Conclusion
Google Play Store is the largest app market in the world but make less money compare to Apple App Store. So we have gone through Google Play Store.
First we have analysed the data, we have done basic data cleaning, treating null values and then done EDA. The datasets will give better insight to the app developer about people's demand/choice, so then can do better optimization to the app. We have also done analysis on rating so it will help developer to know if app is performing better or not.
